**Kaggle Competition Solution – EfficientNet-B0 + ArcFace**

A complete, **reproducible pipeline** for detecting and identifying authorized employees in CCTV frames.  
The notebook trains an **EfficientNet-B0 backbone with an ArcFace head**, augments the provided reference photos with video-frame extractions, filters by face quality, grid-searches optimal thresholds, and finally produces a `submission.csv`.

## Project Overview
The goal is to **match every face in CCTV frames to a known employee ID** or label it as `"unknown"`.  
Key steps:

| Stage | What happens | Cells |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Data sanity & cleanup** | Drop broken rows; verify all image paths. | 1 |
| **Frame extraction** | Sample 500 evenly spaced frames per employee from reference videos. | A |
| **Dataset assembly** | Merge CCTV images, static photos & extracted frames; stratified split. | 2 |
| **Model training** | EfficientNet-B0 backbone → 512-d projection → ArcFace head (70 epochs). | 3 |
| **Gallery building** | Embed reference gallery, run FIQA quality filter, cosine threshold search. | 4 |
| **Threshold grid-search** | Jointly tune soft-max confidence `P_TH` and cosine `τ` for macro-accuracy. | 4B |
| **Hybrid inference** | Combine classifier & gallery for final predictions; save `submission.csv`. | 5 |

## Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone & open in Jupyter or Kaggle
git clone https://github.com/your-org/employee-cctv.git
cd employee-cctv

# 2. (Local) create environment
conda env create -f env.yml      # or pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate cctv

# 3. Download competition data into /kaggle/input
kaggle competitions download -c identity-employees-in-surveillance-cctv
unzip identity-employees-in-surveillance-cctv.zip -d kaggle/input

# 4. Launch notebook and Run-All
jupyter lab
Tip: On Kaggle, simply “Copy & Edit” and hit Save & Run All – GPU T4 runtime is automatically provisioned.

Methodology
Aggressive augmentation on CCTV images (crop, JPEG artefacts, blur, perspective, erasing) to mimic surveillance variability.

ArcFace head provides angular margin for better class separation; cosine similarities are later reused for gallery matching.

Hybrid decision rule

If soft-max probability ≥ P_TH → trust classifier.

Else, fall back to gallery cosine ≥ τ.

Otherwise label "unknown".

FIQA filtering removes the noisiest 20 % of gallery faces, boosting similarity reliability.

Grid search over (P_TH, τ) on the held-out CCTV split maximises macro-accuracy, the competition metric.

Training & Validation
bash
Copy
Edit
# default: 70 epochs, batch=32, lr=3e-4 (AdamW), cosine schedule
python train.py --epochs 70 --batch 32 --lr 3e-4
Best held-out macro-accuracy: 0.81 (will vary ±0.01 due to randomness).

To reproduce exactly:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py --seed 42 --epochs 70 --checkpoint effb0_arcface.pt
Inference & Submission
bash
Copy
Edit
python infer.py \
  --ckpt effb0_arcface.pt \
  --gallery gallery.pt \
  --p_th 0.58 \
  --tau 0.46 \
  --out submission.csv
Outputs a submission.csv ready for Kaggle upload:
